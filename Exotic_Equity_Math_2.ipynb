    "An exotic equity derivative is characterized by its payoff functional:\n",
    "$$\\Phi: \\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$$\n",

    "where $r$ is the risk-free rate and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the risk-neutral measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** By the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing, the absence of arbitrage implies the existence of a risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ such that discounted asset prices are martingales. The discounted derivative price process $e^{-rt}V_t$ must be a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale, hence:\n",
    "$$e^{-rt}V_t = \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[e^{-rT}V_T | \\mathcal{F}_t] = \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[e^{-rT}\\Phi(X) | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\n",

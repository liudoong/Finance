    "In credit risk modeling, the **hazard rate** (or intensity) framework is widely used to characterize default probabilities. This approach is consistent with survival analysis and intensity-based credit risk models (see, e.g., Lando (2004), Duffie & Singleton (2003)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the instantaneous hazard rate for counterparty $i$ at time $t$ be denoted by $h_i(t)$, defined on the time horizon $[0,T]$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "which represents the integrated intensity of default risk.  \n",
    "On a discrete time grid, $\\Lambda_i$ can be approximated by numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **cumulative default probability (PD)** of counterparty $i$ from $0$ to $T$ is given by the standard survival function relation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PD_i(0 \\to T) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda_i).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a portfolio of $N$ counterparties with exposure weights $w_i$ (which may correspond to exposure at default (EAD), notional, or equal weights), the **portfolio-level cumulative PD** is defined as the weighted average:\n",

    "\\text{PortfolioPD} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \\cdot PD_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "In the **constant hazard case**, the hazard rate of counterparty $i$ is assumed to remain constant over the horizon, denoted $h_{c,i}$.  \n",
